# NLP_Medicines-Side-Effect-Analysis

Have you ever looked up your common cold medicine on the Internet only to be horrified by the number of side-effects listed under it? Or gone through the review section to verify them but got overwhelmed by the sheer number of reviews listed you probably couldn’t read if you had all day? Or wished there was a simple way to know how many people who used it were satisfied with the results?

Most of us have been there, done that. As humans, we tend to prefer our information to be presented to us in a nutshell, such that we can comprehend it effectively while utilizing minimum time and resources.

The same is applicable for the above case, where a comprehensive and visually informative system is needed to summarize all the information about the medication in one place, which helps the user in making an informed decision before choosing a particular drug.

How can ML aid this process?

The distributed information in the form of blogs or specialized websites for user drug reviews has huge potential for analysis. However, this data is mostly textual, which means that it needs to be structured and cleaned before it can be used for analysis.

A complete end-to-end system would take this unstructured data into consideration and transform it into useable features, which in turn are used by suitable algorithms to determine whether the drug will be effective or not, given review(s) of the drug.

## Objectives of the final system would be:

Providing an overview of the effectiveness and adverse reactions of a drug, aggregated from individual auto-classified reviews into three distinct categories, that are, effective, ineffective and adverse.

Visually represent and compare drugs for adverseness, giving further insights into the reviews for each drug, ranked by each category.

##Code Can't be disclosed as part of the legalities involved, only very high level presentation is shared and available research papers on the Business problem context because I feel working in data science and machine learning is an exciting and challenging field. New techniques and tools are constantly percolating and honestly, it can feel overwhelming. Many of these new developments are found and first revealed in academic research articles. Extracting knowledge from these articles is difficult because the intended audience of these papers tend to be other researchers. Yet in order to stay current reading papers is an essential skill — luckily one that can be improved with diligence and practice.
